# BC-R-AMEX-Default-Prediction
**R-Based Credit Default Prediction Model**


**A Machine Learning Project utilizing Kaggle AMEX anonymized dataset to predict defaults. **

**Project Description**
This project develops a predictive model using R to estimate the probability of credit card payment defaults. Utilizing the American Express Default Prediction dataset from Kaggle, the model aims to forecast whether a customer will fail to pay back their credit card balance. The dataset includes anonymized and normalized customer profile features from each statement date, categorized into Delinquency (D_), Spend (S_), Payment (P_), Balance (B_), and Risk (R_*) variables. The goal is to predict the likelihood of a future payment default for each customer.

**Data Source**
The dataset is sourced from the American Express Default Prediction Kaggle Competition. It spans 18 months of customer data and classifies a default event as non-payment within 120 days post the latest statement date. Notably, certain features like 'B_30', 'B_38', 'D_114', etc., are categorical.

**Technologies Used**
